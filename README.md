# Integrated Kid Games

**Overview**

This all started as an *End-Sem project* during my 3rd semester *C++ Programming* Course in *IIIT-Bangalore*. I then coded to include `Airline` to the portal. As I fell in love with this project, I, during the *semester-end holidays*, extended it to include `Bus` routes & services too to the application.

**How to run the application?**

- Download the zipped application from the **master** branch of this repository.
- Unzip all the folders and files. 
- Generate the executable by compiling and linking the object code. Then, execute the **TravelPortalIntegrated** program. Please keep the **txt** files intact in the folder to run the portal.
